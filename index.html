                I was inspired by this single conversation starter.
                <p>Upon examining my iPhone weather app I realized it was composed of cities beyond the one I live in and those I have visited; it included those that were homes of people I love.<p>Being long-distance from family and friends has always been a reality for me, and somehow seeing their weather conditions, their clocks, is a way of bridging a distance, that painful knowledge that we don’t share physical space in this moment and can’t see each other at will.

                I see my temperature, my wind speeds, my sunset, not as they are but in relation to those of others. Through an attempt to express this relativity was born Distances, the weather app for humans who don’t share space.

It is an exploration of the way digital documentation allows access to our former selves and sentiments in the form of limited glimpses, familiar sounds, and floating memories.

                <div id="ptpl-phone-text-desc-2">As humans we are constantly mourning not just the loss of others but the loss of ourselves, the moments we can never return to. Yet there are instants when our memories are triggered involuntarily despite their fallibility. Beyond the taste of a madeleine as once written by Proust, the proliferation of the cell phone video has allowed us to create these access portals to our past lives through digital documentation. Here are some of mine.
